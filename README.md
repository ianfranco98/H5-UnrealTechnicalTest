A technical test that I made to demonstrate my programming knowledge using UE5 C++.

This was the requested requirements: 

1. Create a new Unreal Engine 5.1 project.
2. Implement player spawning and replication. Ensure that each player can see the other player's vehicles.
3. Implement vehicle movement based on player clicks. Use pathfinding to calculate the paths for the vehicles. The camera should always follow the players vehicle, smooth camera movement is a plus.
4. Implement the shoot action: When the player presses the spacebar, the controlled vehicle should fire a projectile in the current direction of the vehicle. If the projectile hits an opponentâ€™s vehicle, the player gets 1 point. The hit vehicle should immediately respawn at a different location. (either random or a player start, up to you)
5. Implement a scoreboard widget that displays the player names and their scores. Ensure that the scoreboard updates in real-time for all connected players.
6. Add some obstacles to the map using the basic built-in shapes! The vehicles should be able to navigate around them and the obstacles should block projectiles.
7. Build an elevated platform and a ramp which vehicles can navigate up to!
